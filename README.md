### Introduction
Micro Management is an exciting game developed for the AI Game Jam, where you take on the role of a manager responsible for guiding an individual named Michael to fix electrical boxes placed around the map. The game leverages Speech-to-Text technology to capture verbal commands from the player and utilizes OpenAI's powerful GPT model to interpret and execute those commands for Michael.

### Gameplay
Your objective in Micro Management is to efficiently direct Michael to repair the electrical boxes within the allotted time. Each electrical box has a unique set of issues that need to be addressed, and it is your responsibility to provide Michael with clear and specific instructions to fix them. However, be aware that Michael's behavior can be influenced by random elements, so your commands may not always result in the desired outcomes.

### How to Play
